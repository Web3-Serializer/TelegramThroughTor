*Because sometimes, your messages deserve a cloak of anonymity.*

## What‚Äôs This Project?

This PowerShell script helps you:

- **Install the Tor Expert Bundle** if it‚Äôs not already on your PC ‚Äî so you can run Tor without fuss.  
- **Start Tor as a background process**, giving you a local SOCKS5 proxy at `127.0.0.1:9050`.  
- **Create a Telegram shortcut** on your Desktop with a custom Tor icon ‚Äî making it easy to launch Telegram configured for anonymous proxying.  
- **Provide simple, clear instructions** on how to configure Telegram‚Äôs proxy settings to use Tor.

## Why Should You Care?

While Telegram is secure, routing it through Tor adds a layer of privacy by obscuring your IP address and network location. This can be crucial for:

- **Privacy enthusiasts:** Who want to keep their digital footprint minimal.  
- **Journalists and activists:** Who need to bypass censorship and protect sources.  
- **Anyone in restrictive environments:** Where communication can be monitored or blocked.

---

## How It Works

1. The script checks if Tor is installed, if not, it downloads and extracts the Tor Expert Bundle.  
2. It launches Tor silently in the background as a local SOCKS5 proxy.  
3. It creates a Telegram Desktop shortcut that uses your custom Tor icon.  
4. It shows clear instructions to configure Telegram to connect through the Tor proxy.

## A Few Notes of Caution

- Tor can slow down your connection, that's the price for anonymity.  
- Always verify that Tor is running and proxy settings are correctly applied.  
- Understand your local laws about using Tor and proxies.  
- This script does not modify Telegram internals; proxy settings must be enabled manually as explained.

## Ready to Use?

Clone this repo, open PowerShell **as Administrator**, and run the script. Then follow the on-screen instructions to enable the SOCKS5 proxy inside Telegram:

- Server: `127.0.0.1`  
- Port: `9050`  
- No username or password needed.

## Final Thoughts

Privacy is a right, and sometimes you have to take extra steps to keep it. This project is a simple but powerful way to add Tor anonymity to your everyday Telegram chats. Stay safe, stay private, and happy messaging! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüó®Ô∏èüîí
